Enneagram Instincts (SP, SX, SO) and Subtypes by Russ Hudson (https://twitter.com/russ_hudson54) 
Instincts 
Important: everyone has all three instincts/subtypes. No one is missing any of them. Thus, the helpful question here is NOT which one am I, but what is my relationship with each of these? The latter question gives you leverage for really finding balance in your life. 
One of the challenges with Enneagram work is the tendency to use descriptions we agree or "resonate" with to reinforce our self concepts--sometimes even negative ones. The real purpose is to see through our self concepts to a deeper truth about who and what we are. 
This gets even trickier when we look at the instincts. The instincts are "closer to the bone," & while the behaviors they generate are even more obvious than our type patterns, they are oddly harder for us to see objectively. Often our loved ones see them more clearly than we do. 
This is likely because our instincts are intimately connected with survival needs, thus they are more defended. Also, they make us aware of aspects of ourselves that are closer to the animal kingdom-- what we share with other creatures. The instincts are an adult conversation. 
When we are present, especially in our bodies, our instincts operate well, helping us to survive & even thrive on planet earth. When we are hungry, we eat. When we are tired, we rest. They also tend to come into better balance. We aren't overriding needs. 
To the degree we are not present, our instincts become distorted by fear & by the passion of our Enneagram type. The "subtypes" are really about how the passion gets mixed up with the instinct. To understand the subtypes, it is helpful to really understand the passions. 
It is necessary to understand the instincts as instincts--to know how they operate when they are NOT mixed up with our type patterns. Otherwise, we will not know how to use this information to develop better balance and to free our instinctual intelligence from ego issues. 
Instinct is the part of us that is part of nature. If it's instinct, you can see it on various nature programs online or on TV. Human beings have instincts, & all traditional spiritual paths have tried to find ways to work with them. They understood how important this was. 
Sometimes they simply denied them, and there are disciplines around renouncing comfort & security (self pres), celibacy (sexual), & giving up worldly ambitions, being a hermit (social). In Enneagram work we seek to integrate them by bringing embodied awareness to them. 
So it is useful to know our instinctual life in an intimate, personal way. This will challenge many of our self concepts, but it will also be a powerful way to break out of some of the imbalances that tend to create recurrent problems in our lives. 
There are many ways of describing our instinctual drives & the Enneagram looks at them as 3 clusters. The Enneagram teaches us to think in 3s instead of in 2s--in dualism. Dualistic thinking is static--it doesn't move. Right or wrong, up/down, black/white, in/out, yes/no. 
Thinking in 3s introduces dynamism & change--gets us unstuck. This was a normal way of seeing things in the ancient world. All the major religious traditions look at triads emerging from unity--in the Enneagram symbol it is the triangle in the circle. Trinity from oneness. 
Almost everything meaningful in the Enneagram follows this triadic logic. We describe 3 clusters of instincts: self pres, sexual (attraction), & social. I will show that each instinct has within it 3 zones-- areas of focus. This really helps us understand each instinct. 
Our RELATIONSHIP with each drive is what is important. When we say we are one of these--when it is our subtype--we tend to over-emphasize it. We are more preoccupied with it, often at the expense of attending to other important areas of our lives. We may or may not be good at it. 
I came up with the zones after teaching about the instincts for years. I found that by organizing the material into smaller bites, people understood it better, and it helped them see they don't have to agree with all of it for it to be their dominant instinct. 
9 zones. SP: 1) Health 2) Resources 3) Home. SX: 1) Attraction 2) Exploration 3) Fusion. SO: 1) Reading people 2) Connecting 3) Contribution. I hope these distinctions make it easier for you to work with this material. So a few things to keep in mind. 
Even if an instinct is dominant, it doesn't mean you will be strong in all 3 zones. Usually one lags. And you will have at least one zone working in your weakest instinct. It's helpful to look at all 9 zones & explore your relationship with each one of them--customize this. 
As we will see next, discovering our weakest instinct, which I call our "blind spot," ends up being the key to growth. The relationship between the strongest instinct & the blind spot is more important than deciding "which one I am." None of them is " my identity." 
As you ponder the 9 zones I have described, see if you can notice which areas you spend a lot of time with vs those that might need some more attention. It helps to let go of ideas about your dominant instinct while you do this. Kindness and presence are huge helps here! 
Best not to assume you already know about this. We might THINK about doing certain things, but some areas actually get our time and attention. Others, less so. We need to be gentle but honest with ourselves, and then a picture emerges of the habitual patters of our lives. 
We will get a felt sense about what will bring more wholeness & balance. This we can work with! We get insights into realistic changes that can support us flourishing & can create customized practices to integrate them. Now we begin to get what the Enneagram is really about. 
Blind Spot 
So we want to look at the "blind spot"--our least developed instinct which has a lot of impact. It is tricky because this part of us creates issues & can even be mistaken for our dominant instinct as a result. 
I am not totally certain our dominant instinct always stays on top. Many people have reported that their 1st & 2nd instincts sometimes have changed places. I have seen though, that the blind spot doesn't move. We can learn to work on it, but the habit to neglect it remains. 
Just as with our dominant instinct, we can see the symptoms of our blind spot. One is that it creates some of our most ongoing & painful negative self-concepts. Our inner critic brings these old fears 
up whenever we try to change our instinctual orientations & habits. 
All of 3 blind spots come with forms of negative self talk, that function to keep the "old way" in place. These patterns were formed in early childhood and were likely necessary for our psychological well being at the time. But the patterns don't know we have grown up. I should add that these self attacks do not always come as voices. They can manifest as losing energy, shutting down, feeling anxious, etc. This can be signs that we're getting close to our ego defenses. Then we need extra kindness & sometimes support from others. 
With all 3 blind spots, the idea is that none of the negative voices are true. But they scare/humiliate us out of trying new behaviors. When we DO tend to these neglected parts of our lives, we generally feel better & more balanced. We get less obsessive about our dom. instinct. 
What I learned from years of working w. the instincts & seeing what helped my students is that it doesn't really work to try to "not do" your dominant instinct. It is like saying "whatever you do, don't think of the color blue." Just turns us into a psychological pretzel! 
What DOES seem to help is giving more compassionate attention to the blind spot. This tends to restore balance throughout & once we work through the initial resistance & inertia, we tend to feel way better about ourselves. It seems to take the pressure off the dom. instinct. 
This doesn't mean copying the habits of people who have our blind spot as their dom. instinct. Often they are overdoing it & we don't need that. Part of the fun & creativity is finding our own way to address these needs. It usually helps to get support in learning new ways. 
One clue about finding our blind spot. We tend to get triggered when a person whose dominant instinct is our blind spot is doing their "overdoing" of the instinct. It triggers us because it is shadow material--making explicit something about ourselves we haven't seen. 
If SP is our blind spot, seeing people fuss about SP issues drives us nuts. "Leave the thermostat alone. Why can't they get a life? Are you packing for a year?" If SX is our blind spot, we tend to see SX dom people as too much. "Such show-offs. Tacky. Get a room already." 
If SO is our blind spot we see SO dom. people as shallow, wasting time "socializing." "They are fake & don't really care. No one is talking about anything deep." The clue is that others aren't having the same reaction. People MAY be doing neurotic stuff, but WE are triggered. 
Self-Preservation (SP) 
Self Preservation: ALL living things have this instinct, even bacteria. It is an awareness of our health, well-being, and of having the necessary resources for our survival. If we are surviving, we seek to thrive & to be more comfortable. It's that basic. 
All humans have this instinct but for some it becomes a preoccupation & for others a lower priority--even an area of neglect. We all have programming around this instinct, & our inner work is hugely helped by knowing how our fears about it get triggered, one way or another. 
Instincts are part of "body intelligence" which manifests as sensation. If you are hungry you don't need to think about it. It's a sensation in your body. The same with being tired, cold or satisfied. Becoming more aware of these direct sensations helps ground us in presence. 
Self Preservation is a fundamental to all life--it is a drive way more fundamental than anything in our personality. Plants turn towards the sun. Amoebas will swim away from water that is too hot or cold. It manifests in animals as ways to obtain food & shelter & avoid danger. 
Self Pres can be located in 3 zones of concern/behavior. 1) health, diet, rest, exercise, etc. We pay attention to our physical well-being. The healthy side of this is genuine self care, listening to our body awareness. Getting real nutrition, exercise, rest. 
When we are not present, our ego fears & distort our relationship with SP causing us to not listen to the body's wisdom & real needs. For ex. we might overeat for fear of starving or starve ourselves for fear of being fat. We might be indolent or exercise ourselves to death. 
To work with this zone of SP is a process of listening to the bodies messages as sensations, 7 discerning this from the fears that cause us to neglect our needs or exaggerate them through fear. 
The 2nd zone of self pres instinct is practicality and resources. Part of survival is having necessary resources. In human affairs this also means the management & maintenance of those resources. These can include items such as money, possessions, time and energy. 
Self pres dom. people tend to have a practical streak--this can be anything from being skillful running a business or personal finances to knowing how to fix things. There is a sense of persistence & going for long-range goals. They work to maintain the foundations of life. 
W/o presence this can lead to constant worry about resources & a grasping approach to life. Then SP dom people never feel relaxed or sufficiently secure. SP dom people might be focused on both the 1st & 2nd zones or only good at one of them. Each person is different that way. 
The 3rd zone of self pres instinct is domesticity--creating & maintaining a home. People strong in the SP instinct may express this as a focus on home-life. This means doing what's needed to keep a home, but also liking to be home as a place to relax & recharge. 
One way people dominant in SP instinct may express the instinct is in cultivating a grounded, stable domestic life. They may prefer to be home than to travel or go out, & may develop skills for making the home comfortable & practical--sometimes even beautiful. 
W/o presence, this talent for domestic order can become a pattern of lethargy--becoming stuck in ruts. It can also lead to fears of stepping outside of familiar tracks. Positively, we tend to do better when we have some kind of sound foundation/base of operations for our life. 
The 3 Zones of Self Pres in the Enneagram are 1) self care/health 2) practicality/resources 3) domesticity/home. When we are more present we simply respond to these needs as they come up. When we are dominant in SP, we get preoccupied & potentially neurotic about these areas. 
Even if we are dominant in SP, we are usually not good at all 3 zones--usually 2 of them with 1 lagging. Some are good at practicality but not at self care for example. If SP is our weakest instinct, we are still adequate or even good at one zone. 
Blind Spot 
When Self-Pres is our blind spot, we may still be competent at certain areas, but overall, our life lacks structure & regularity. We may even resist them. We do things more randomly & our schedule tends to be more changeable. We usually avoid at least 2 of the zones of SP. 
Some of us may really lack self care--avoiding medical & dental check ups, having haphazard relationships with exercise & rest, etc. We eat what we like w/o much thought about diet. We may also lack focus on resources, hoping others will handle this part of life. We get by. 
We may avoid focus on domesticity. Our home may be more of a "crash pad"--the place where I sleep & keep my stuff. We may even fear getting trapped by domestic life, seeing it as drudgery & heaviness. When at least 2 of these zones are challenges, this may be our blind spot. 
When we have trouble with the resources zone of Self Pres, it does not necessarily mean we are "bad" at handling money. It means we do not think about finances very much. We many not have a clear idea of what is in our bank account. We don't give our finances much focus. 
When we don't focus on these money matters, it can lead to trouble. There can be a quiet panicky feeling when we are called upon to deal with financial affairs. Things like contracts & financial discussions can make our eyes glaze over even when they are for our benefit. 
When we finally do focus on our practical foundations, we find it more interesting than we might have imagined & get more relaxed & energized. We feel more confident, finally addressing those nagging feelings in the back of our minds. We can consciously choose this. 
When Self Pres is our blind spot, the self attack is along the lines of "I am a flake. I do not have it together & I never will. I am not sure how to be an adult & I feel like an eternal kid. I don't know how the world works & I am not sure how to establish myself in life. 
We sometimes try to overcompensate by emphasizing how youthful we are, what "free spirits" we are, but in more vulnerable moments these assertions feel hollow & we are left with the helpless feelings. It is important to realize these voices are NOT true--they are primal fears. 
Every time we make efforts to address our SP blindspot, some variation on these fears & negative voices may come up. So we learn to recognize them, take a deep breath, let the fear pass through us, & discover our own way of dealing with this part of life with skill & love. 
Sexual (SX) 
Before I go into the 3 zones of Sexual Instinct, I want to offer a few distinctions. This is a tricky area to talk about because society has complex relationships with the topic. It is also an area rife with hurt/trauma/disappointment, etc, so we need to approach this gently. 
First off, this instinct really is about sexuality/eros which is a huge part of every human being. It is NOT about intimacy per se. Intimacy is a heart quality. You could also think of it as chemistry, attraction, or creative energy. It activates and enlivens--it stimulates. 
I tend not to use the term one-to-one because all dominant instincts seek meaningful one-on-one relating, but ABOUT different things & for different reasons. There is a particular flavor to the quality of this instinctual energy. It gets us out of our comfort zone. 
While this instinct IS about sexuality, our sexuality is about much more than the sexual act. I've worked with celibate communities who understand this well. Think of it as what activates you-- what "turns you on" so to speak. Everyone has this but we express it differently. 
As with SP instinct, SX instinct is easiest to recognize as sensation in the body. SP showed up as specific sensations that tell us "how we are doing." Hunger, warmth, fatigue or feeling rested, etc, all are direct sensations. SX instinct is a different set of sensations. 
SX instinct sensations feels more like tingling--an electrical feeling in the body. We might notice it in some areas more than others. As we pay attention, the feeling grows & fills in, like Whitman's poem "I Sing the Body Electric." When present, we feel more vital & alive. 
Distortions of this instinct bring in fears about desirability--often narcissistic problems. Their can be a need to keep amping up this instinct or a need to shut it down. It can lead to an addiction to risky- taking & even self destructive behaviors. Very different from SP. 
When we are present, SX instinct tends to attract us to people & things that are good for us, that evolve us. When not so present, we tend to get attracted to people & situations that are repetitions of our narcissistic wounds. We keep signing up for the same hurts & heartbreaks. 
The 1st zone of SX instinct I call attraction--both attracting & being attracted, magnetism. People strong in this instinct are more aware of what attracts them--they don't need a reason. They also put more energy into attracting others thru highlighting strengths/features. 
Many dominant in this instinct have heightened charisma. They broadcast a quality of energy that commands attention. Social dominants have something similar, but this energy attracts--draws others in. Even when they are not aware of it, this energy tends to broadcast. 
SX dominant instinct makes us more aware of our own attractions. When we come into a room, we notice the "hot spots"--areas of interest--very quickly. Similarly, it can be hard to pay attention to others when this attraction is not present. We can get restless & impatient. 
The 2nd zone of SX instinct I call exploration & edge. People strong in this instinct are typically more interested in experiencing life powerfully than they are in stability or security. They are drawn to the edges of life, to discovering their own edges, energetically. 
When this zone is strong our whole life has a flavor of exploration & adventure. We may fear getting stuck in a rut & be willing to sacrifice some forms of security to have an interesting lifestyle. This isn't about planning--more going with the impulse to try something out. 
Positively, this leads to a rich life & to broader, deeper experiences that we can bring to our work & relationships. Negatively, it can lead to dissipation or an attraction to danger--edge becomes putting ourselves at risk, drawn into an unsavory demimonde. Self destruction. 
When we are present, this zone helps us to get out of our lethargy, our comfortable "sleep." It activates us, & brings us back to the wakeful intensity of this moment. When not present, it makes us restless & in search of stimulation--it distracts us from our being. 
The 3rd zone of SX instinct I call fusion/merging. It may be this aspect of the instinct that led to the concept of "one-on one." Many strong in SX seek intense fusion with the object of their attention. It goes beyond connecting (which is social) and is not only w. people. 
When this zone is strong we have a strong urge to lose ourselves in something or someone. Certainly with a person we are attracted to, but also to a piece of music or an engrossing book. We seek conversations where the rest of the world seems to fall away. And we like this. 
Positively, this leads to a a beautiful capacity for focus & for being with the energy of another. Negatively, it can lead to a recurrent pattern of losing ourselves in relationships as well as in preoccupations--a difficulty holding a middle ground. All or nothing is tough. 
This should not be confused with intimacy & thinking of ourselves as "intense" or "deep." Most people think of themselves that way. This part of us can involve into a fiery commitment to our awakening, and to to staying on track with our practice regardless of what arises. 
I guess it is worth repeating that all 3 dom. instincts seek intimacy & one-on-one relationship. Most people prefer this to "relating w. a group" which is one reason why many do not realize they are actually social dominant. We just focus on different things in our 1-1 relating. 
Blind Spot 
When Sexual Instinct is our blind spot, it really doesn't say anything about whether we have sex or not. It also doesn't mean that we lack "intensity." There are kinds of intensity that come from other instincts. Social instinct might make us intense about our work, for ex. 
With the SX blind spot, we may feel passions & powerful energies. We may notice desires for new experiences & adventures, but we tend to procrastinate acting on these wishes. We postpone that which activates us & brings us excitement & energy. We turn away from this energy. 
Often, people with SX blind spot feel a heightened sense of responsibility. We had to be the sensible one to keep things together. Following these energies can feel too risky. But we can be surprised at how delighted our loved ones are when we allow our passionate energy. 
When SX is our blind spot, the self attack is along the lines of "I am hopelessly boring. I can't imagine anyone taking much interest in me, & if they do I suspect there is something wrong with them. Thank God I can be useful because few would be interested in me otherwise." 
Imagine if every time you start feeling your mojo, those voices come up. They are designed to make us turn back & give up. Sometimes we overcompensate by thinking of ourselves as wilder & more adventurous than we actually are. But it is more helpful to awaken to the voices. 
Social (SO) 
Social instinct is NOT only about "the group," it is about awareness of the OTHER. How is the other feeling? How are they reacting to me? How am I affecting them? Sexual instinct is about the energy (or lack there of) between us. Both can be present in the same relationship. 
SO instinct began w. parenting. Most species on earth do not parent--it is a fairly late development in evolution. But the awareness of the state of the young became crucial as more complex animals required more time to "grow up." So the parental bond is the origin of Social. 
Many people confuse SX & SO but of course everyone has both of these instincts. The drive to connect, to relate, to know each other, is social. It brings its own brand of intimacy. We can be attracted without bonding, and we can bond without attraction, or both can be there. 
I call the 1st zone of Social instinct "Reading People." When we are strong in this zone we pick up cues from others. We can read facial expressions & body language. We can read between the lines 
of what others are saying & get what they actually mean. We adapt accordingly. 
This zone helps us better navigate relationships. We can read an individual's state or the overall mood in a group. It's also what helps us be good parents/caregivers--we have to be able to sense what the child needs. It helps us adapt & respond to what we detect in others. 
It's difficult to accomplish much w/o some ability to tune into others so this zone is hugely helpful. But w/o presence it can lead to anxieties & self-defeating behaviors, over-concern about others-- fearing exclusion or being devalued. We may reject our own knowing to please. 
Different types manifest this in different ways. We all have a different sense of what we can bring to others and how we can respond to them. But when this zone is strong, we are able to show up w. others & create truly collaborative & reciprocally beneficial relationships. 
Social instinct does NOT mean "socializing." It isn't "small talk." When people get together, it is usually for some reason. The reason might be from one of the other instincts (attraction or practical needs), but can be about other things too. For ex, 5s get together for knowledge. 
SO is about the ability to get together for whatever we might be creating or exploring. This is tough to do if we are not interested in others or assume they have nothing to offer us. If we assume that, we are not paying much attention. But presence restore us quickly. 
It can be helpful to contemplate the question "What DO I like to do, create, accomplish, or explore with others?" There is always something. If our answer is a knee-jerk "nothing," consider that our inner critic might be at work, cutting us off before we even can explore it. 
I call the 2nd zone of Social instinct "Creating & Maintaining Connections." Here, the title is pretty self-explanatory, yet this zone is often confused w. SX because of the misleading "one-on-one" term. People strong in SO work at their relationships & strive for reciprocity. 
This zone helps us in our ability to engage others, & to strengthen connections when it serves our purposes or desires. This does NOT mean that all SO dominant people are extroverts--MANY are introverts. But it does mean that people strong in this zone value communication. 
We might be able to attract people into our sphere with SX instinct, but SO helps us stay engaged with people ( or animals for that matter.) We reach out. W/o presence this zone can deteriorate into codependent behaviors & anxious attempts to ingratiate ourselves w. others. 
When this zone of SO is strong, we are more thoughtful & considerate of others. Beyond simply reading them, we acquire behaviors to connect--to create a sense of belonging for ourselves & for them. Even withdrawn types like 4 & 5 do this thru sharing ideas or experiences. 
The 3rd zone of Social instinct is "Participation & Contribution." Humans NEED to be able to contribute, to know that their efforts are meaningful to others. It is instinctual. In this sense, we can also be passionate about what we contribute to others and this is Social. 
Participation also brings a sense of belonging--that we are welcomed & that what we are doing matters. When people do not feel this in their lives it can lead to depression & suicide. Our contributions may be very local or very public, but we humans don't do well w/o this. 
Participation does not mean joining everything or always wanting to be around people. We could be introverts & love solitude but still have a strong drive to contribute. It is the SO instinct that 
discerns WHAT we participate in, helps us realize what is NOT right for us. 
W/o presence, this zone can deteriorate into constant anxieties about belonging, creating in and out groups, & narcissistic needs to be important. But at its best, is the drive that keeps us contributing to the human journey and creating a meaningful life for self & others. 
A quick reminder: in my experience, SO instinct is NOT about wanting to be in groups. SOs may be more aware of group dynamics, but it is centrally an awareness of OTHER. Also, it is the instinct most concerned w. connection & communication. This often gets confused w. SX instinct. 
Blind Spot 
SO blind spot is NOT the same as introversion. There are many people who are introverts & are also Social dominant. Many when learning the instincts, assume they have a SO blind spot. 
When Social Instinct is our blind spot, we reflexively think being with people is going to be a drag & a drain. It is different from the need to have space to recharge. It is as though we cannot remember that we often gain valuable experience & knowledge through interaction. 
This has nothing to do with not liking groups & parties. Most people have limits in enjoying these! It does not mean we only like 1-on-1 connection. Most SO dominants prefer 1-on-1 communication. It means we resist connecting until we discover the value in the connection. 
People with SO blind tend to associate human connection w. previous disappointments & humiliations. So it feels safer to not engage. "Step out of the sun if you keep getting burned." --Dear Evan Hansen. Healing comes as we discover myriad ways of connecting that work for us. 
People have asked about SO doms who are introverts. If you look at the 3 zones of SO: reading people, creating connections, & contribution, you can see how you might have great skills/capacities in at least 2 of these, but still need lots of private time to recharge. 
SO dominants may really enjoy people but find interacting tires them. With SO blind spot, there is a reaction/aversion to the idea of connecting. "Do I have to?" Again, this is based in conditioning, & we will look at some of the negative voices associated w. this blind spot. 
Social Instinct blind spot comes with another form of negative self talk, although it is a bit harder to pin down than the SP or SX blind spot voices. And as with the others there is a core of self attack obscured by a justification which keeps the old pattern in place. 
When SO is our blind spot, the self attack is along the lines of "There is something deeply defective & shameful about me--especially about my emotions. I feel like I SHOULD care about people, but to be honest, often I don't. I am scared people will see my shortcomings." 
SO blind spot often manifests as an exaggerated self-consciousness. It's hard to relax & be w. people. We are afraid of making mistakes--"faux pas." It feels easier to simply avoid human contact than to risk being humiliated. But then we do not get practice or develop skills. 
We may justify this by thinking people are boring, shallow, clueless, etc. But w. awareness, we see these as defenses against our fears about ourselves. Again, the voices are NOT telling the truth. We discover we connect ABOUT something interesting/important to us. We share. 
Subtypes 
My plan is to show how the passion and the dominant instinct work together to create the subtype. So a couple of things... 
First, remember that these patterns are NOT you--they are a pattern that tends to take over your awareness & limit your perceptions & possibilities. When you notice the patterns in real time, it is a fast track to accessing more of your humanity. It's about being more free. 
Second, remember also that you always have all three instincts working in you, so when you see the pattern that tends to grab you, there is a chance of re-engaging the neglected instinct--to bring loving attention to the blind spot instinct again. 
When I learned about these subtypes many years ago, they were based in 27 names for them which Claudio Naranjo had proposed. In subsequent conversations with Claudio, he explained to me that there was a certain amount of trial and error in his approach. He experimented. 
Rather than do as others had done, trying to make the concepts fit Claudio's names & descriptions, I decided to experiment too. I went back to science books about the instincts/drives & studied how the passions of each type might alter the way the instincts are expressed. 
I then worked with 1000s of students to see what most helped. I now plan to tweet some of my observations about the 27 subtypes. In most cases, they agree with Claudio's descriptions & with the work of colleagues. In a few they will not, & I will explain why I see it as I do. 
As we go through the 27 subtypes, keep in mind the zones of each instinct that I tweeted about earlier. Even when a particular instinct is dominant--part of the so-called subtype, the pattern will not necessarily play out in all 3 zones equally. Some areas may even be neglected. 
--- One --- -- SP -- 
The SP1 is the passion of resentment in the SP zones. Some use the term anger for the passion but I find it too blunt & general. I see it more as a sense of frustration & exasperation. But here, I am frustrated about self pres matters & feel there is a "right way" to do them. 
SP1s focus their perfectionism on health & self care issues, & on the practical matters of maintaining a home & business. They are not necessarily focused on big social issues, but know how to maintain a kitchen or a set of accounts or what vitamins or diet would be best. 
Generally, SP1s have done their homework but can also hold very strong opinions about practical affairs. In some cases, they can even become advocates or media personalities educating the public on health & practical issues. They may also create beautiful home environments. 
When troubled, they may impose rigid philosophies on instinctual matters, such as staying on a strict diet which may or may not support their health. They can become obsessed with issues of purity and contamination. At their best, they are kind & wise guides to living well. 
Naranjo called SP1 Anxiety but I find this name too general. I call this combo Self Control. Sp1s try to create order in their personal life, seeking to be well organized, clean, & consistent. They feel the rightness of their way of living is the best hedge against chaos & loss. 
-- SX -- 
The SX1: resentment/frustration in the SX zones. "The SX zones are not being done correctly." SX1s often do not look like stereotypical 1s. They tend to be adventurous--it's often as if they have lived different lives in the same life. They're perfectionistic about energy. 
SX1s are attracted to SX energy, but want it to be classy, elegant. They are charismatic but with a sense of refinement--a dashing quality. They often seem as if they came from an earlier time, yet this is part of their allure. They notice how well others handle themselves. 
As 1s, SX1s want to bring high standards & a kind of purity to their intimate relationships, but this sometimes clashes with their raw attractions. Sometimes they have a hard time finding partners because few can meet their standards. "This person seems perfect! Oh wait..." 
When troubled, SX1s can get depressed over never finding the perfect match, or can become very controlling of a partner, fearing they may stray from their idealized sense of an energetic union. At their best, they're loyal, charming, creative & willing to go where life leads. 
Naranjo called SX1 Jealosy or Zeal. I call SX1 Shared Standards: also Chivalry. It seems to me the whole idea of chivalry, of elegant courtship, is related to this perspective. While SX1s do charm with their elegance they also are the 1s most likely to get wild occasionally. 
Surprisingly, the zone of merging is big with SX1s. They have great focus & want to stay in sync with the objects of attraction. When they meet someone who feels right, they can be anxious about maintaining the high standards of the relationship. It was so hard to get here. 
I've seen that SX1s don't like to fill up space. They like pauses in conversation & take their time communicating. Like SX9s, they read the energy in a situation, but are also evaluating it. They sense that life could be lived from a higher & purer energy. "Will you join me?" 
One more thought about SX1 & the name "zeal." I think all 1s can be zealous but about different things. Certainly SO1s are zealous about social issues & SP1s are zealous about how SP needs are addressed. Yet there's something to the name that fits SX1. 
Perhaps the combination of the dominant SX instinct & the passion of 1, resentment/frustration combines to forge a somewhat fiery temperament. I do notice that SX1s can be obsessive in the manner of some 5s. When they are interested in something it is not a casual interest. 
I note that when SO1s are more fixated, they judge others around SO issues--justice, fairness, etc. When SP1s are stuck, they judge around laziness, sloppiness, etc. With stuck SX1s, it's more generalized. People are low-lifes, etc. They may judge people for lacking decorum. 
I'd add that SX1s are more likely to allow themselves the space to do creative work. They don't feel guilty about following a creative path as some other 1s might. Most 1s I know appreciate art, music, and creativity, but SX1s are more likely to make the time to pursue these. 
-- SO -- 
The SO1: resentment in the SO zones. "Social issues are not being done correctly." SO1s are most like the stereotypical idea of 1s. They focus their desires for improvement & their potential perfectionism in the social sphere. Don Riso's name The Reformer applies best here. 
SO1s can be found in many professions but they are often drawn to politics & journalism. They are natural activists, seeking change in society, and pointing out injustice and corruption when they find it. They are concerned w. being publicly in integrity w. their stated views. 
SO1s focus on the contribution zone of SO. They like to have a mission in life but can be so fiercely focused on their chosen causes that their personal life & relationships may suffer. They may even see personal needs as an indulgence. Despite this, they can be loyal friends. 
When troubled, SO1s can be intolerant, completely convinced that their views are correct, driving friends away w. rants & harsh views. Openly judgemental. At their best, they lead by example, inspiring others w. their wisdom, compassion, warmth, & ability to walk their talk. 
Naranjo called S01 Inadaptabilty: highlighting that while the SO instinct is about adaptation, the fixated 1's belief in having a correct view may counter that SO capacity--producing trouble in yielding to other's ways. I call SO1 The Crusader, noting their focus on causes. 
In SO1s the capacity for adaptation is found in their willingness to make sacrifices for a greater good. They see the long range picture & can delay gratification for a better future. This can be a great help & example for others, but can also become a self-denying lifestyle. 
SO1s are naturally generous--they will give the shirt off their backs to someone in need w/o hesitation or need for affirmation. They can be highly triggered by seeing what they deem as selfishness or self-indulgence in others. Their compassion & understanding win the day. 
--- Two --- -- SP -- 
The SP2: the passion of pride in the SP zones. I translate pride here as: "I don't need this, but YOU do, so let me do this for you." Pride here means let me attend to your SP needs. This kind of 2 gets concerned about the health, wellbeing, & practical needs of others. 
SP2s can be quiet powerhouses--Don used to call them "the iron fist in the velvet glove." As SP dom. types, they have strong willpower & know how to get things done. But of all the 2s they have the most inhibition about doing things for themselves. Shame arises around need. 
SP2s may have skills in any of the SP zones, but tend to project their needs so it can be harder to detect. An SP2 may be a great healer, yet lack self care. SP2s can wear themselves out doing their best to make sure others are cared for. They can be practical for others too. 
When troubled, SP2 can develop psychosomatic problems--their bodies pay the bill for unprocessed emotions. Of the 2s they are more likely to seek sympathy for their sacrifices. But at their best, they learn genuine self care & can be truly gifted at addressing real needs. 
Naranjo called SP2 "Me First," but I find this one of the most problematic names. It has also led to people thinking of this as "the 2 that doesn't give" which in my experience is actually another type. And it overlooks the nature & particular distortion that pride creates. 
Thus, in Naranjo's 27 subtypes, the caregiver, self-sacrificing type disappears. It is not described. Clearly, there are many people for whom this is a central structure. Again, pride means "I don't need it. But I can give it to you." This gets focused in different instincts. 
I have called SP2 "Entitlement" & "Rewards." After giving so much to others, I deserve to get MY SP needs met. I have earned them. But often our "rewards" are not what we actually need, i.e., sugar. SP2 inner critic can be harsh--I can address my needs AFTER helping others. 
SP2 is a great example of how type doesn't tell us everything. SP2s can be creative, brilliant, talented, funny & many other wonderful qualities. Yet the PATTERN of SP2 tends to be what I get caught in--what limits the true expression of my gifts & keeps me alienated from myself. 
A personal point on SP2: I am always moved by the fundamental kindness & care of SP2s that extends to every kind of being, as well as their understanding that life is about service. SP2s may have great knowledge & skill, but they know that such gifts are for the benefit of all. 
-- SX -- 
The SX2: the passion of pride in the SX zones. For me, this is "I don't really need sexual energy, but you do, so let me give it to you." SX2s have high energy & are often quite outgoing. They engage the world with humor & a bold spirit & they are often mistaken for 7s. 
SX2s are often described as seductive, but really all SX types can be seductive. SX2s conquer the objects of their attraction by lavishing them w. attention & interest. Even though they are good at transmitting their own SX charisma, their power lies in focusing on others. 
SX2s focus on the attraction & merging zones of SX inst. They have the ability to make other 
people feel attractive & desirable--a very winning formula. They pick up on the interests of those they are drawn to & learn about those interests. The seek to create deep connection. 
When troubled, SX2s can get obsessed w. the objects of their attraction--feeling rejected yet unable to accept the rejection. This can lead to aggressive behavior. At their best, they are creative champions of others, deeply loyal friends & companions, & inspiring healers. 
Naranjo called SX2 Aggression. True, but I feel this is too much part of the pathology of SX2--not where most people will find themselves. I call this combo "Craving Intimacy." 2's desire for intimacy & closeness combines with SX instinct's need for energetic fusion. 
The type and instinct combine here to create a powerful drive toward certain others. The result is a person who seeks intense closeness with specific people, although not with everyone! SX2s want to have a few key relationships & to earn a special place in others' lives. 
This drive for closeness can create problems w. jealousy & possessiveness. But when SX2s work thru these issues they are extraordinary friends. They reclaim their own energy & can be highly creative, especially in the performing arts. They can convey powerful emotions. 
It's interesting to note that all 2s often have many unused talents & capacities, i.e. math ability or skill in visual art. When 2s learn to reclaim themselves, finding their own beautiful center again, they often have a personal renaissance, exploring their once neglected gifts. 
-- SO -- 
The SO2: pride in the SO zones. "I don't need this but you do. Let me do that for you." SO2s are the matchmakers of the Enneagram, supporting people & causes they believe in & see ways people can connect for mutual benefit. They are good mentors, seeing the gifts of others. 
SO2s are more often successful working w. organizations than the other 2s. They have good emotional intelligence although they often FEEL awkward themselves. People generally like them although when they are insecure, others may notice them trying to hard to be appreciated. 
SO2s focus on the building relationship zone of SO. They remember things about people & have a gift for making others feel included, wanted, & appreciated. They make their way in life by using their social gifts to create alliances around their work & meaningful causes. 
When troubled, SO2s can overbearing & manipulative, often w/o realizing it. Their efforts to make themselves important to others often alienate people. At their best, they create conditions of welcome, acceptance, & a powerful sense of shared purpose. Great facilitators. 
Naranjo called SO2 Ambition. Yes, but I'd call it UNCONSCIOUS ambition. SO2s often do not realize how ambitious they are. They can even feel shame around their desires to be important/central, so rise through their affiliations w. others. I call SO2 Everybody's Friend. 
The 2's capacity for noticing others emotions is strong here. SO2s move toward other people, making a point to create positive friendly interactions w. strangers--getting a smile from the lady at the checkout counter. They are also more shrewd & political than the SP & SX 2s. 
SO2s are not caregivers like SP2s, but they help by nurturing capacities & by creating opportunities & connections for others. They take joy in seeing others flourish, but when less healthy are afraid of being cut out of relationships between people they've introduced/helped. 
--- Three --- -- SP -- 
The SP3: the passion of vanity in the SP zones. I translate this as "To be valuable, I must excel in this instinctual area." Thus, SP3s strive for excellence in the 3 zones of Self Pres. These are the hard-working, list-making, task-oriented 3s. They often mistype as 1 or 8. 
SP3s are not "flashy" so they may not relate to some descriptions of the 3. They're the "get things done" people, which is a wonderful asset. When SP3s get more fixated though, they become workaholic and don't know when to stop. They may bring spreadsheets on their vacations. 
SP3s are usually most focused on the practical maintenance zone: they value efficiency & effectiveness. They may have an exercise routine they work into their busy schedules & do care about fitness as part of their capacity to perform. They may rely on others for a nice home. 
When troubled, SP3s may focus on work to the detriment of their relationships, losing connections w. loved ones & becoming isolated. They are at risk of burn out. At their best, they are warm, seeking good uses for their skills & supporting others with their work & dedication. 
Naranjo called SP3 "Security," which does highlight the way this kind of 3 is less image oriented. I call this subtype "Efficiency" while the more troubled aspect is "Workaholism." SP3s are the people most concerned w. efficiency & managing/streamlining their time & energy well. 
-- SX -- 
The SX3: the passion of vanity in the SX zones. "My value comes from excelling at attraction." Not all SX3s are classically good-looking, but all know how to enhance their attractiveness & charisma. They can pick up on what others are attracted to & become more like this. 
SX3s have learned how to charge up their charisma, and can do so when needed. They "turn it on." They can become a sort of blank slate on which others project their fantasies & desires. They know how to cultivate "a look"--this can range from a culture-ideal to exotic/strange. 
As SX types, they seek powerful union, but while confident in their power to attract, can also have self-doubt about their ability to sustain relationships. Most SX3s know how to get attention through their attractiveness, but start to fear this is all others see in them. 
In a bid to be seen for their depth, SX3s may rebel against their attractiveness--rejecting their former images. When in trouble they can get lost in promiscuity & addiction, trying on one image after another. At their best, they can be brilliantly creative, cultural heroes. 
Naranjo called SX3 Virility/Femininity, pointing to SX3's capacity to become the idealized role in their sexual milieu. "I am what you have been looking for." I call this combo The Catch, as in "Wow. He's quite a catch." SX3s often work hard at grooming & fitness. 
In youth, SX3s may go through a variety of intense relationships, but as they get older, they tend to seek intimates and partners who can draw out their depth & intelligence. They still know how to attract, but learn this "superpower" does not have to be used all the time. 
SX3s tend to have more access to their feelings than other 3s & are more easily hurt. They're often 
drawn to the arts & have a strong aesthetic sense. They may mistake themselves for 4s, especially with a 4 wing. But like all 3s, they can lay feelings aside to get things done. 
-- SO -- 
The SO3: vanity in the SO zones. "My value comes from excellence in the social sphere." S03s are the most adaptable 3s--they intuitively pick up what is most appropriate to the situation and match it energetically. This isn't premeditated & happens instantly, before thinking. 
SO3s fit the general description of 3s: they are charming & ambitious, exhibiting professionalism in their chosen field. Much of their journey is learning to tune into their own dreams & wishes rather than being led by what they perceive is expected of them. Not obvious. 
SO3s focus on the reading people zone of SO, but also the contribution zone. They work hard to "rise above their rank" & feel an ongoing need to prove themselves. They are often exemplars of their profession & are able to model qualities that others admire & respect. 
When troubled SO3s can be adaptable to a fault, disappearing into self images & losing touch w. their real heart's desire. Overarching ambition can lead to a downfall. At their best they are gracious, gifted, sensitive & truly interested in helping others develop their gifts. 
Naranjo called S03 Prestige: this makes sense. SO3s look for tangible signs that they are making progress. They want to be recognized for their hard work & achievement. But even when they receive accolades they often remain driven & dissatisfied with themselves & can burn out. 
SO3s learn from their mistakes & try different methods to achieve their goals. Much healing comes when they start to examine their concepts of success, noting the difference between external markers of success & what makes them FEEL good about themselves. A rebirth can follow. 
SO3s can be more isolated than they are appear--feeling like soloists under pressure. They begin to find connection through cooperation in tasks. They love helping others discover their talents & use them well & make excellent coaches--inspiring others to personal excellence. 
--- Four --- -- SP -- 
The SP4: the passion of envy in the SP zones. I translate this as "hypersensitivity & particularity in this self pres matters." SP4s seek to create environments that are comfortable as well as rich in beauty & symbolic meaning. Colors, lighting, textures: these things matter. 
SP4s are the most introverted 4s. They tend to prefer time at home or in quiet environments. Their SP orientation makes them practical in the sense of being aware of resources, but less people- oriented, especially with the 5 wing. Still, intimate conversations are welcome. 
SP4s are usually most focused on the domesticity zone: the atmosphere of their home is important. Among 4s, they put more effort into practical maintenance & may focus on health via dietary choices, supplements, etc. Some are athletic, but many have trouble w. consistency. 
When troubled, SP4s get stuck in their private worlds. Nothing feels right--the princess & the pea syndrome. They get lost in self indulgences which do not help their depression. At their best, they are profound guides to inner life & invite others into real human experience. 
Naranjo called SP4 Reckless/Dauntless. I have found this term misleading. It gets confused with counterphobia such that 6s, 7s, & 8s mistype as reckless SP4s! I discussed this with Naranjo years ago & he agreed. I call the SP4 "The Sensualist" for the reasons I have described. 
The "Reckless" is not bungee jumping or rock climbing. It's putting emotions above practical needs. "I don't have money for rent but I must have this antique clock." "My job interview is tomorrow at 9, but I am nervous.I will have another cocktail & watch this old movie." 
SP4s can develop by realizing that they better meet their SP needs through successful relationships with others.They discover that their natural introspection is actually a great gift to others & they can contribute much throughtheir insights & creative expression. 
-- SX -- 
The SX4: the passion of envy in the SX zones. Envy can be a bit complex, so I also use the term hypersensitivity for 4s in relation to instinct. "I am deeply affected by attraction and the lack thereof." The lives of SX4s are powerfully directed by what most activates them. 
SX4 reveals the problem w. language. We might say, SX types are intense, but really all 4s & 8s see themselves as intense, & many people do in general. What do we mean? SX4s are led by what has energy for them, & are willing to live risky lives for the sake of that energy. 
SX4s emphasize the edge & fusion zones of SX inst. They tend to live unorthodox lives. Security & stability are not big values for them. They seek powerful immersion in whatever is the object of their attention & can be uninterested in anything that lacks attraction for them. 
When troubled, SX4s become extremely volatile--going between intense love & hate. They can be attracted to what repeats a troubled history. At their best, they are profoundly insightful, humane, & unbridled in their creativity. They welcome us to embrace our messy humanity. 
Naranjo called SX4 Competition & it is true that they can be highly competitive sexually--both 
overtly & covertly, seeking to overcome feelings of inadequacy by winning SX competition. I call SX4 Infatuation because of their "all-or-nothing" attitude with attraction & love. 
A trap for SX4 is to become attracted to people I envy--who have qualities I wish I had. This can lead to mixed feelings about the other & to a diet of self-criticism: I am daily reminded of what I think I lack. Lots of healing for SX4 comes in seeing thru such idealizations. 
SX4s don't think of beauty in terms of classically "nice" things, instead finding it in the rawness of life--even in suffering. Thus, through their insights & art they are masters of helping others accept & land in the naked truth of their experience & authentic feelings. 
SP4s tend to be more introverted, private & self contained than SX4s. But this doesn't mean SX4s are "people people!" All 4s tend to feel some degree of social awkwardness, but SX4s are looking for friends & partners with whom they can swim in the intense energies of life. 
-- SO -- 
The SO4: envy/hypersensitivity in the SO zones. "The social sphere is not getting me." S04s highlight how SO instinct is about what we connect with but also what we don't. SO4s feel like they don't fit in, but are looking for the place where they might--their chosen family. 
SO4s are more outgoing & adaptable than SP or SX4s, but they are still 4s--melancholic & aware of a longing to find the place where they belong. They may relocate. As SOs they can be cooperative and supportive, but they feel the need to distinguish themselves from the crowd. 
SO4s focus on the the contribution zone of SO, feeling they have something significant to contribute & seeking like-minded peers to gain mirroring & encouragement for their talents & views. Thus, many SO4s are drawn to alternative lifestyles, connecting through "otherness." 
When troubled SO4s feel shut-out, misfits whose envy of others' contributions can be expressed in bitterness & harsh self-criticism. At their best, SO4s are leaders in creating cultures & environments in which creativity, beauty, & respect for the individual can flourish. 
Naranjo called S04 Shame: perhaps pointing to the self blame that arises in wanting to belong but feeling one doesn't. Some SO4s overcompensate for this by seeking to be more glamorous/interesting than others. I call SO4 The Outsider, addressing a constant feeling for them. 
SO4s take comfort in finding friends who like them, feel like outsiders. They can be a great source of healing for others, helping them come to accept who they are, celebrating their "quirks." While not everyone in a subculture is a SO4, many subcultures reflect these values. 
SO4s find healing in discovering that they have much to contribute & that their unique sensibilities are much needed, even when not initially accepted. Healthy SO4s are profoundly non-judgemental. Having explored their own darkness, they are a safe space for others to do so. 
--- Five --- -- SP -- 
The SP5: the passion of avarice in the SP zones. I translate this as "minimizing & containing needs in self pres." SP5s are the classic 5s in that they are the most introverted and the most needing solitude & space. They are the 5s who can easily feel drained by interaction. 
SP5s take pride in their ability to not need much in the way of comforts. But they have a great need for privacy & space. They may indeed enjoy going out to see friends, but they want to know when the gathering will be over. They are highly protective of their energy levels. 
SP5s, like SP4s, often focus on the domesticity zone, but in a very different way. Comfort & beauty are not priorities, but a space that feels like my domain, a place to think, to explore w/o interruption, to have my resources around me, is vital. Self care is seldom a focus. 
When troubled, SP5s can become eccentric or even delusional through extreme isolation. They may cut off from friends & allies, & descend into mental illness w/o reality checks. At their best, they follow a different drummer, & combine original thought w. human warmth & humor. 
Naranjo called SP5 Castle emphasizing the tendency to isolate and to create a fortress-like existence in the home. Stockpiling the castle can manifest as a tendency to hoarding. I call this subtype Solitude as it's a primary value for SP5s, although it can lead to isolation. 
Not every introvert is a 5. Enjoying private time is shared with 9s & 4s & the introverted expressions of any type. Further, avarice is not "being stingy with knowledge." Few 5s are that. It is withholding the self & the heart. It is an anxious contraction away from contact. 
Also, enjoying reading or learning is not the sole province of 5s. Many types enjoy these things. They key element in 5 is a capacity for long-term concentration & focus--even to an extreme degree. Most 5s collect things & the SP5 especially so. Look for shelves in the home! 
-- SX -- 
The SX5: the passion of avarice in the SX zones. Avarice doesn't mean greed. It's withholding the heart & it is resisting need. Thus, "I don't want to need too much SX instinct, but..." SX5s are caught between the SX drive to become deeply involved & the 5 drive to pull back. 
SX5 tends to be more imaginative & creative rather than purely intellectual, especially with the 4- wing. The creativity here is provocative & dark, as if to frighten away those who aren't truly interested. SX5s test others to see if they can handle their strange inner worlds. 
Like SX4s, SX5s emphasize the edge & fusion zones of SX inst. The edge part is obvious--they like to explore the strange & forbidden. SX inst. can drive them to risk emotional connection, but when hurt they also can withdraw for a long time, perhaps staying single for years. 
When troubled, SX5s become nihilistic, withdrawing into a world of nightmarish fantasies & becoming overtly self-destructive. At their best, they invite others to see the strange wonder of existence, and may create artistic or scientific innovations well ahead of their time. 
Naranjo called SX5 Confidence. This has a double meaning: the sharing of confidences--secrets & 
hidden knowledge, but also that SX5 needs confidence to overcome the impulse to withdraw & approach the object of desire. SX5s can be avoidant of those they are most attracted to. 
I call SX5 "This is My World." SX5s present peeks at their dark inner world, fairly convinced that most people will be turned off or dismiss them with nervous laughter. But if the other is intrigued, energy & interest go up, & the sense of fusion & exploration is unleashed. 
SX5 loves the freaky, sometimes disturbing elements of life, finding some of it also funny. It is worth noting that a number of horror writers & movie directors are 5s, & many SX5s. H.R. Giger is an example, his art is a blend of sexuality & the grotesque, but in a novel way. 
-- SO -- 
The SO5: avarice in the SO zones. “I don’t want to need much social contact.” S05s highlight how SO instinct is NOT about socializing. Most 5s dread socializing but SO5s enjoy communicating about topics of interest--sharing their knowledge and learning from smart people. 
SO5s are usually introverts, but they engage through their areas of mastery & focus. They are ok with being in social settings as long as there is a role to play that employs their expertise: being a DJ or a bartender or a teacher. W/o such roles they can feel overwhelmed. 
SO5s focus on the the contribution zone of SO, feeling this is perhaps the only way they can connect. They may lack capacities for bonding & reading situations, but are loyal friends & are sensitive to others being treated disrespectfully. They are curious about people. 
When troubled SO5s can be quite anti-social, isolated, & angry at society. They can feel futile & that despite their gifts, they will never have a place in the world. At their best, they excel at communicating challenging ideas & inviting others to explorations of reality. 
Naranjo called S05 Totems: looking at how 5s connect through ideas & archetypal energies. For SO5s, SO instinct is about intelligent communication--helping the world be smarter. I call SO5 The Specialist, b/c of the need to develop in-depth expertise in particular subjects. 
SO5s often feel they have something special to convey to the world, & seek to connect with others who have "done their homework." They are the most friendly 5s but seek the company of those who like them, have mastered something. The feel validated by being in such company. 
SO5s may spend much time devoted to studies or developments of skill, but they grow as they learn to see how such knowledge & skill serves others. Their expertise is in service to healing & genuine connection rather than being used as a way to distance. Mind serves compassion. 
--- Six --- -- SP -- 
The SP6: the passion of anxiety in the SP zones. For me, this is "concern & worry about self pres matters." SP6s are the Sixes who worry & focus on issues of security, safety, stability, & "planning for a rainy day." They probably invented banks and insurance companies. 
SP6s are generally cautious & methodical. This doesn't mean they can't cut loose & have fun. They do! But they feel it is their duty to be the custodian of the safety of not just themselves, but also their loved ones. They work hard trying to hold their world together. 
SP6s tend to focus on the practical maintenance zone of SP. They take on their responsibilities with a seriousness that can look like type 1. Yet their home life is also important as a place to unwind from the stresses of their work. Home is a sanctuary to be protected. 
When troubled, ALL 6s can have issues w. anxiety, depression, substance abuse & aggression. Paranoia here tends to be about SP matters ergo intense & survival-based. At their bests, SP6s contribute their intelligent awareness to maintaining the foundations necessary for life. 
Naranjo called SP6 Affection--here I see it differently. His description of traits for SP6 are to me those of the SO6 because ALL SO types emphasize connection. I also experience that all 6s can be warm. This does not distinguish the instincts. For me, SP & SO got reversed. 
I call SP6 Responsibility, like Naranjo's name for SO6, Duty. I find SP6s to be more serious about responsibility--willing to do even unpleasant tasks if it means maintaining the safety & security of what they care about. They don't need glory, just want the work done. 
SP6s may show love by supporting others through taking care of the SP details of life--paying bills, doing contracts, saving money, doing chores etc. They are not doing this for attention--finishing tasks helps SP6 relax, but also really is a way of supporting loved ones. 
-- SX -- 
The SX6: the passion of anxiety/doubt in the SX zones. "What can go wrong in the SX zones?" SX6s tend to draw their sense of security from the quality of energy more than from structures, inner or outer. They trust their intuition more than other 6s & may live edgier lives. 
Because SX6 goes more by their sense of energy they can seem more counterphobic & prone to risk-taking. But really all 6s have both phobic & counterphobic tendencies. It is a matter of emphasis. As a result, SX6s may not initially see themselves as 6s, often more as 4s or 8s 
SX6s emphasize the edge & attraction zones of SX inst. Attraction comes upon them powerfully 7 often suddenly, but they also know how to attract. They seek consistency & stability less than SP or SO 6s, & may be drawn to exciting or even dangerous forms of fun--adrenaline. 
When troubled, SX6s experience extremes of emotion (like 4s) & can be erratic in their relationships. They can be quick to blame others for their problems. At their best, they are engaging, dynamic, creative, & bold trail-blazers for others. They blend tradition & innovation. 
Naranjo called SX6 Strength & Beauty, referring to SX6's capacity to adopt gender roles in a way 
that attracts. Similarly, I call SX6 Feisty Vulnerability. I note that SX6 can play the required role, but also protests it. They cultivate a side to them counter to their role. 
SX6 women often have a "tomboy" aspect to them & prefer hanging out with the guys. SX6 men have a flirty, almost feminine side to their masculinity, and prefer hanging out with gal pals. The 6 "yes, but" energy seems to play out in the realm of attraction & sexual polarities. 
I'm not talking about sexual preference, but about how SX6 navigates polarities in sexuality. This would be true in non-cis 6s as well. The inner polarity produces a complex inner life that can be expressed in winning wit & creativity or in a confusing, erratic emotional life. 
-- SO -- 
The SO6: anxiety/angst in the SO zones. “What can go wrong with my social support system?” SO6s don't want to hang out w. people all the time, but they understand the importance of cooperation to get anything done. They are usually friendly & can be excellent communicators. 
SO6s work to create trust--finding common ground where possible. They approach others with warmth & sometimes humor as a way of disarming. As 6s, they are anxious & trust can be a challenge, so they seek to create safer social spaces, thus reducing their own anxiety too. 
SO6s focus on the the connecting zone of SO, but they are often skillful at reading situations too & care deeply about contributing. Many SO6s feel a strong obligation to support their communities, & being of service to others is a value regardless of their profession. 
When troubled SO6s are prone to paranoid views of other groups, creating an us-against-them mentality. They can also become extremely socially isolated & suspicious. At their best, they are loyal, hardworking friends, inspiring & enrolling others toward shared goals & dreams. 
Naranjo called S06 Duty: agreements & shared responsibility are important to them, as is personal honor. I have called this combination Engaging Support because of their ability to remind people of their higher nature, & their skill at enrolling others to help out when needed. 
SO6s are approachable & enjoy sharing stories & good times with friends. They can resemble 9s, but with strong 6ish vigilance. They are willing to make sacrifices for the greater good like 1s, particularly for family or friends, & are often moved by selfless acts of others. 
SO6s connect through shared interests--a sport, a hobby, playing in a band, & are often dedicated learners. They are not particularly "gushy" but want their friends & allies know that they "have their backs." They do not seek leadership but rise to the occasion when needed. 
--- Seven --- -- SP -- 
The SP7: the passion of gluttony in the SP zones. For me, this is "I can never have too many self pres supplies." SP7s are generally the most practical 7s--feet on the ground. They know what they want & do what is necessary to obtain it. I deal w. anxiety by acquiring comforts. 
Some might call SP7s materialistic, but I find them worldly. SP7s do like nice things & luxury when they can get it according to their economic means. They know how to get upgrades! But they feel their anxiety more directly than other 7s & this is how they soothe themselves. 
SP7s focus on the maintenance & domesticity zones of SP. They tend to be hard-working so self care tends to be pampering. Spas, getting a massage, a nice meal, etc. They are the most practical 7s & can have good business sense, knowing practical work provides their comforts 
When troubled, SP7s can indeed become grasping, impatient, & materialistic--infantile tantrums when they do not get desires met. Prone to repressed anxiety that bubbles over. At their best, they know how to orchestrate people & activities to achieve dreams for self & others. 
Naranjo called SP7 Defenders. It has been explained to me but I find this one of his strangest & most obscure names. I think Helen Palmer's original name for all 7s, the Epicure, is a good name for the SP7. More fixated, I also call them Getting Mine. Worldly-Wise is another. 
Defenders has a truth, but isn't the core issue. Trying to take care of oneself through acquiring more SP supplies is. I have joked SP7s are the master shoppers in all senses of that word. They don't like to waste money--bargaining, finding deals is part of the fun. 
SP7s like to care for others by sharing the treasures they have found. They know the latest good movies, good restaurants,good books, good places for a walk or a vacation. It brings them joy to share their special places & things with loved ones. They've done their research. 
-- SX -- 
The SX7: the passion of gluttony in the SX zones. "You can never have too much stimulation." SX7s are the wanderers & explorers of experience--they have the feeling that life could/should be a collection of peak experiences. The seek new frontiers, new ideas & ways of living. 
SX7s are less focused on comfort than SP7s--backpacking in Bhutan, trying new foods & meeting fascinating people is more their way. SX7s can look like 5s: they get turned on by exploring novel, exotic ideas. US counterculture in the in the late 60s had a lot of this flavor. 
SX7s emphasize the edge & attraction of the SX zones. Less into merging, they do experience powerful attractions & not only to people. They can be charismatic but are not particularly self- conscious about it. Yet they are confident in their power to get others interested. 
When troubled, SX7s get caught up in increasingly reckless "adventures." They may harm themselves thru their excesses & exhaust their resources, both inner & outer. At their best, they are trailblazers, wise & loving friends. They inspire others to reach for their dreams. 
Naranjo called SX7 Fascination/Suggestibility. I prefer the first term. SX7s live to pursue what 
fascinates them, & fascination is a mix of mental & SX energy. I call SX7 The Neophile--a word I made up, meaning the lover of the new. SX7s seek the novel in experience. 
SX7s are often up on the latest trends & developments in their fields of interest. They are the 7s who most like to synthesize new ideas from different things they have learned about. The get excited by ideas but can get carried away by them too. They tend to trust their whim. 
SX7s love encountering people, but unlike SOs they experience people as new worlds to explore-- possible sources of revelation about ideas or experiences. Part of their journey is learning better discrimination--some experiences & ideas look enticing, but don't lead to much. 
-- SO -- 
The SO7: gluttony in the SO zones. "One can't have too much social involvement & connection.” SO7s are on a search to find where they want to put their talents, time, & attention. They may "try on many different hats" looking for work & a place in life that feels right. 
SO7s are big communicators--they love conversation & learning about the world, & are often great storytellers. The SO instinct makes them more earnest than some 7s, & they often have a strong idealistic streak--sometimes thinking they are 1s. They motivate & encourage. 
SO7s focus on the the participation/contribution zone of SO & are more aware of others' feelings than one might initially guess. SO7s often get deeply involved in a project or job, but often move on to something else which is not always directly related to their previous work. 
When troubled SO7s can become intensely restless, unable to settle in any situation & growing increasingly angry with themselves. They know that they are smart & talented but cannot galvanize themselves. At their best: generous, brilliant & loyal, raising hopes for all. 
Naranjo called S07 Sacrifice: pointing to their altruism. As SO types, SO7s seek connection & contribution, but gluttony causes them to wonder if they should be doing something else. Is there a better job/place for me? Is this it? I call SO7 Missing Out for this reason: FOMO. 
SO7s certainly know how to play & explore, but w. SO dominant, they also are dedicated workers, friends, & partners. While they may be up for an adventure, their 7 quality manifests more in liking to explore different social circles, conversations, work & even spiritual paths. 
The cliche that 7s won't commit is generally overstated. SO7s particularly seek meaningful connection & commitment. But they want to make sure they have committed to the right work & the right people. They often express love by showing possibilities that others have not seen. 
--- Eight --- -- SP -- 
SP 8 is the 8 passion of lust applied in the Self Pres Zones. This is the highly practical 8--the business-oriented 8. When this is the subtype, we are intense about creating & sustaining foundations for our life & maintaining a safe home for ourselves and our loved ones. 
SP8s tend to be hard-working, focused, & direct. Usually the zones of resource management & domesticity are strong, but often the zone of self care is lacking. SP8s are highly independent & creative in the sense of starting things & construction--they like to build things. 
Of the 8s, SP8s are most likely to be introverts. They need more alone time than other 8s & treasure their private time. They are very clear about what they like & do not like in food & other matters. They know how to relax but are proud of their no-nonsense approach to work. 
I call the SP8 "The Survivor," which is similar to Naranjo's "Satisfactory Survival." The name highlights the pragmatism & practicality of SP8s. The often express love by taking care of practical needs. Adversely, SP8s are most likely to be triggered by perceived "weakness." 
-- SX -- 
The SX8: the passion of lust in the SX zones. For me, this is "I need to be in control of the sexual energy." SX8s are often highly charismatic, making bold lifestyle choices. They often get feedback of being "too much" & are looking for those who can meet their big energy. 
SX8s can be practical, but they're less focused on material matters than SP8s. They're looking for experience & drawn to energy & immediacy. While they can be quite intense, they are also more openly vulnerable than SP or SO8s. As SX types they seek powerful fusion w. others. 
SX8s focus on the exploration & attraction zones of SX. They broadcast their signal powerfully & are on the lookout for strong response. They desire the merging zone but it challenges the 8 need for boundaries & self protection, thus this becomes a real growth edge for them. 
When troubled, SX8s get into tempestuous relationships where struggle & dominance substitute for intimacy. They can have bad tempers & lack impulse control. Substance abuse. At their best, they are dazzlingly creative, adventurous, & inspiring, inviting others to live fully. 
Naranjo called SX8 Possessiveness. This points to the lower level aspect of SX8s seeking to dominate relationships--the desire to mark the object of attraction. I call SX8 Taking Charge which has a double meaning. It refers both to the dominance AND the love of energy/charge. 
As with all of the SX types, there is a strong urge for self expression, & there are many SX8s in the creative arts & especially performing arts. This provides the immediacy, energy & opportunity to broadcast or "transmit" to use Mario Sikora's term for the SX instinct. 
SX8s often joke & tease to test the durability of potential partners & friends. They like to get a rise out of people they like. They tend to trust powerful attraction more than intimacy, yet crave it, & like all 8s their journey is to discover the power in their sensitivity. 
-- SO -- 
The SO8: "lust" in the SO zones. "I need to be in control of the social sphere." SO8s are vivacious, outgoing & engaging. Of the 8s, they are most likely to "wear their hearts on their sleeves." They have a big drive for connection & want to have significant impact on others. 
SO8s tend to be an axis for other people to come together--others are drawn into their sphere. They may function as heads of their family: they work to get people together. They place a premium on personal loyalty & are intense about their commitment to friends & loved ones. 
SO8s focus on the bonding & contribution zones of SO. They are hard workers & do their best to maintain their alliances & playmates. When their 8ness is triggered, they may be less skilled in reading others' emotions or registering their impact. They openly express feeling. 
When troubled SO8s get feelings hurt more easily than is obvious & may lash out or reject others-- accusing of disloyalty while themselves betraying their commitments. At their best, they're powerful movers & shakers, making things happen & supporting others to have an impact. 
Naranjo called SO8 Friendship & this makes sense to me. I call SO8 Gusto & Camaraderie: SO8s love sharing rich times w. trusted others. They love conversations & engage them w. great energy-- although sometimes too much for some! For them it is in the spirit of real connection. 
SO8s want to create intensely real bonds of trust & to provide meaningful service in the world. They are fiercely protective of loved ones, but when hurt or disappointed may have huge reactions, banishing former friends--often w. much self-justification. Hard to say sorry. 
Like all SOs, SO8s are generally warm & enjoy getting to know others. They love creative partnerships of all kinds, but when less present can become bossy & demanding w/o realizing it. They are also won over by others speaking their truth & meeting them with honest energy. 
--- Nine --- -- SP -- 
SP 9 is the passion of sloth applied in the Self Pres Zones. SP 9 is an interesting contradiction--at once the most easygoing 9 but also the most stubborn. SP9s tend to be grounded & to appreciate simplicity. They generally prefer to keep their lives uncomplicated as possible. 
The SP variant of each type tends to introversion, and SP9 is no exception. SP9s enjoy solitude & are particularly attuned to nature. They have a live & let live attitude but are also the 9s who can most easily tell people off if offended. They like to go at their own pace. 
They can be very practical & are often valued for their common sense. Of the 3 zones, they tend to have problems w. self care & are the 9s who can get caught in ruts--becoming resistant to new experiences. They can be brilliant & creative, but are also genuinely humble. 
Naranjo called SP9 "Appetite"--referring to one way this type may try to narcotize. I call this combo "The Comfort Seeker"--noting that there are many ways we humans try to be comfortable, & the healthy side of SP9 is the capacity to relax & simply be. SP9s help others land too. 
-- SX -- 
The SX9: the passion of sloth in the SX zones. For me, this is "I can't have what I really want in the sexual energy, but this will work." SX9s are often highly romantic, creative, & sensual. The SX energy brings more volatility to feelings so they are often mistaken for 4s. 
SX9s combine an earthy sense of enjoyment w. an ethereal quality that is difficult to describe. They attract w. a presentation of innocence & openness--even though they may be highly experienced in the ways of the world. They have a rich fantasy life & love stories & symbols 
SX9s emphasize the merging zone as well as the attraction zone, although their desire to merge can clash with the 9 wish for autonomy. Thus, SX9s may go back & forth with the objects of their attraction--becoming intensely involved then moving away to restore themselves 
When troubled, SX9s can feel torn between the need for space & the need to merge. They may resolve this through triangulated relationships but can also lose themselves in fantasies about a perfect partner coming along. At their best they are brilliant, sparkling, & passionate. 
Naranjo called SX9 Union & I call SX9 Merging. Here Claudio & I are quite close in our observations. Many SX9s do not easily recognize themselves as 9s. They can be adventurous, free- spirited, & creative in many ways. They express their passions more openly than SP or SO9s. 
As SX types, SX9s are good at broadcasting: they know how to attract. They sometimes feign surprise when others are interested, but it may be true that they know quite well what they're doing. They often write well, & their personal notes & diaries can be full of richness. 
Even w. verbal skills, SX9s prefer nonverbal expression. They are often fond of music, dance, symbols & imagery, & can be talented in these areas. They tend to "pick up" energies from others, including animals, & base many decisions on what they feel in others' energy field. 
-- SO -- 
The SO9: "sloth" in the SO zones. "I can't get what I really want socially, but this will do." S09s can be outgoing, positive & purposeful--they can resemble 3s & 7s. While externally engaged w. others, they can maintain an internal aloofness, a safe distance emotionally. 
SO9s are the mediating 9s--the 9s who easily see different sides of a conflict & help people come together around an issue. They're often trusted as leaders because people sense they will be fair. They have a gift for making others feel welcome & included--they seek consensus 
SO9s focus on the bonding & reading zones of SO. They sometimes struggle finding their purpose but can pursue goals when they feel someone believes in them. They want to belong but get annoyed with themselves when they lose their identity in relationships or group dynamics. 
When troubled, the usually energized SO9s become flat & listless. They are prone to depression & a sense of futility, surviving through basic routines. At their best, they are wonderfully sensitive & inclusive, inspiring leaders, & profoundly supportive friends & partners. 
Naranjo called S09 Participation: deciding what to participate in is important, because SO9s are deeply influenced by who & what they engage. I call SO9 One Happy Family, because of their wish to be inclusive. Helen Palmer's name for 9s, The Mediator, also works well here. 
SO9s can be introverted, but are more likely to be found in organizations than SP or SX9s. They have the ability to be involved while maintaining an "untouched" inner world. When stressed, they still show up but are disengaged emotionally. They have a robust sense of humor. 
Much the journey for SO9 is learning how to belong without "blending" into the culture or values of others--even in intimate relationships. They discover that people sincerely want to know their authentic hearts, & when they trust this, their wisdom can be hugely healing.
